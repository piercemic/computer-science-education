- Unlike browser DOM elements, React elements are plain objects, and are cheap to create.
- Applications built with just React usually have a single root DOM node, but can have isolated nodes.
- To render a React element, first pass the DOM element to ```ReactDOM.createRoot()```, then pass the React element to root.render():

```
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(
  document.getElementById('root')
);
const element = <h1>Hello, world</h1>;
root.render(element);
```
- React elements are immutable (an object whose state cannot be modified after it is created.) Once you create an element, you canâ€™t change its children or attributes. An element is like a single frame in a movie: it represents the UI at a certain point in time.
- React only updates whats necessary to bring the DOM to its desired state.
